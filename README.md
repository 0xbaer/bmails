<H4> what is bmails? </h4>
<P>
<br> Bmails is an email solution for the blockchain domains to communicate with rest of the world! With the current infrastructure for the decentralized web it's almost hard to put together a system which could sent and receive emails in a dynamic way.
This is unfortunately a centralized alternative for email with authentication and resolution of ENS,ZNS and .crypto domains using the blockchain.
